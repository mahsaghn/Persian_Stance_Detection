# stance_detection_persian

The purpose of this project is to find a suitable preprocessing for a Persian corpus; then apply machine learning techniques to detect the stance of a given claim to an arbitrary article. 

## stop words
There are some meaningless words in the corpus that removing does not make any change in the meaning of a given text. It is worthwhile to choose a suitable stopword list in the dataset context. In different contexts, word values may differ. Four different lists are used to train and test the model separately. To see the effect of each run:

``run /bash/compare_stopwords.sh`` 
## Tokenizer
## oversampling
